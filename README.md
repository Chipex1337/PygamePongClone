# PygamePongClone
A simple clone of Pong using Pygame and SDL2.
As the before descriptions says, nothing more nothing less

This thing generates all the graphics in-code, meaning it should run anywhere so thats nice.
Currently the collission code is utter ass and neeeds to be re-done from the ground up.

This was the first 'actual' project I did, hence the questionable structure and usage of Global when I had no idea what was happening

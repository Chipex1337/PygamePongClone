# PygamePongClone
A simple clone of Pong using Pygame and SDL2
As the before descriptions says, nothing more nothing less

This thing generates all the graphics in-code, meaning it should run anywhere so thats nice
The reason I uploaded this is because there is a weird bug in part of the code
I'll upload an .exe using pyinstaller after this bug gets solved
